			<p class="facts_description">
				Bishop was born with chocolate brown fur with a white patch going down his chest.
				As he started to shed, the fur started to turn jet black. Now that he's getting older, his
				fur is starting to revert back to chocolate brown (and gray patches). He went through his wild
				puppy phases, and terrible teenage phases up until 4 years old. It was torture, but he's finally calm.
				He's the best dog in the world.
